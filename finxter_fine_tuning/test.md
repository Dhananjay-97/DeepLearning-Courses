Hey {User},

To profit from change, we need to increase ownership of disruptive trends.
Today's article covers a question that many Finxters frequently ask:

🪴 [ **Blog** ] [How to Invest in OpenAI?]({Link}) 🌳

While it's not possible to invest in OpenAI directly, the blog discusses five
alternatives:

  * **MSFT** (49% stake in OpenAI),
  * **NVIDIA** (makes more revenue from OpenAI than any other company),
  * **ARKVX** ( _Anthropic!_ ),
  * **META** ( _Llama 2!_ ), and
  * **TSLA** (Optimus!).

Check it out if you're interested in any of those! No financial advice. 😊

Be on the right side of change. 🚀  
Chris
